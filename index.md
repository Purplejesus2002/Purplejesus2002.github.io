### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    Lab 2 only has one part. However, it was an easy and interesting lab teaching us how to properly take in user inputs and print them correctly using std::cout and std::cin. It also served as a good basic grammar review as we were working with singular and plural nouns. We also learn how to utilized our desire variables. Not much to discuss about this lab since there weren't that many interesting concepts.
* Lab 8

    lab 8 is another one of my favorites as we started working on some very interesting concepts that will be encompassing future computer sciences projects. What I was referring to was manipulating vectors (Creating, accessing, and utilizing) and also for loops. Especially in the judege_functions.cc where we have to create multiple different loops for different limits of scoring. During this lab we also been working with command-line argument concepts. Mainly making sure that the command line positions are correctly allocated to the correct spots(I.E not including the “make test” as one of the unit test inputs)
* Lab 11

    Lab 11 was the most recent lab that I’ve completed with my partner and I’d argue that it is the hardest out of all 12 labs available. However, there is a reason it made my top 3. This lab is the first official lab that made me feel like the “safety handle” that the professor gave us for the past few labs was taken off. The instructions for each TODO were a bit vague when it came to working with constructors. I personally did not understand what It was asking us, not until my partner pointed out that we have to access private constructors and initialize them with the correct data member. Most of the times we would have just avoided any files with the .h types, but this time we had to actually look around and search for clues in order to solves our problem.
